This is a national-level large-scale solar site dataset based on USPVDB data (see https://energy.usgs.gov/uspvdb/, downloaded in early 2024). The variables are mostly included in USPVDB data already. 

The "visibility" variable is based on the viewshed analysis in the PNAS article, which is detailed in the main text and SI appendix. It is a continuous variable representing the number of properties from which the solar site is visible. Code for this viewshed analysis is also included in this replication package.
